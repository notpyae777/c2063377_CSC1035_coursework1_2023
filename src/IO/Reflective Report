This AuctionHouse project is aimed to reveal details of the items and the AuctionHouse itself. This coding's main purposes
are to get (the record sale, price of the record sale item and average price of the item and List of all items sold by the
auction house with a price greater than a given amount of money)-> code is written under AuctionhouseItemReport Package in
the AuctionHouse class. Another main purpose of the code is to get ( name of item, customer's name, lot number, price and year)
-> code is written under AuctionhouseItemReport Package in the Item class. The IO package holds more AuctionHouse and Item classes
which will run the code.

 Overall this project is really fun to learn and helped improve my abilities in using Intellij Idea(Java).
This is my first time coding Java so I have some disadvantages but i tried my best. I would definitely try to get more knowledge
out of Java which will definitely improve my skills on it in the future.
